## Building Resilient Cloud Infrastructure with AWS

# AWS 2-Tier Architecture: EC2 with MySQL RDS

# Overview
This repository documents a 2-tier AWS cloud architecture designed to host a scalable and secure web application. It consists of EC2 instances in the public subnet and a MySQL RDS database in the private subnet. The architecture is deployed in the N. Virginia Region (us-east-1) and spans two Availability Zones for high availability.

# Components

 # Amazon VPC: 
   Custom Virtual Private Cloud to isolate network resources.
 # Subnets:
    Public Subnets (AZ a & b): Host EC2 instances for frontend/application layer.

    Private Subnets (AZ a & b): Host MySQL RDS instances securely.

  # Amazon EC2: 
    Virtual servers to run application logic or web services.

 # Amazon RDS (MySQL): 
   Managed relational database service in a private subnet.

 # Internet Gateway: 
   Enables internet access for public subnet resources.

 # Route Tables: 
   Control traffic routing within VPC.

# Use Case

Ideal for:

 E-commerce applications

 Internal business applications

 CMS or blogging platforms

 MVP deployments

# Deployment Instructions

 # VPC Setup:

  Create VPC with CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

  Set up 2 public subnets and 2 private subnets across different AZs.

 # Internet Gateway:

  Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC.

  Modify the route table to enable internet access from public subnets.

 # EC2 Instances:

  Launch EC2 instances in each public subnet.

  Use security groups to allow HTTP/HTTPS and SSH access.

 # RDS MySQL:

  Launch a Multi-AZ RDS MySQL instance in the private subnets.

  Restrict access using security groups that allow access only from EC2 instances.

# Security Considerations

  Use least privilege IAM roles.

  Apply Network ACLs and Security Groups to segment access.

  Enable Multi-AZ and automatic backups for RDS.

  Disable public access to RDS.

# Scalability Recommendations

  Add a Load Balancer (ALB) in front of EC2 instances.

  Use Auto Scaling Groups for EC2.

  Consider adding a NAT Gateway for outbound internet access from private subnets.
